## Election-Audit Summary:
There's powerful insights and application that can be used across different businesses for high level audit analysis. In this case using Python to conduct an indepth analysis on a local county voting results and poll. Whether this on a small level as a high school class or analyzing votes for the next President to the United States. As we move to a more digital world, voting methods have changed as well. We can have online voting via computer or mobile phones in the foreseeable future. Using Python to conduct analysis on these kinds of polls, we can rapidly provide real time results and see important factors for any election at any level. Voter turnout, vote count, the winner of these votes, etc. Businesses and canvassing campaigns can use Data Analytics to get faster results in a more efficient manner considering the large scale of data that is involved with election results. Not only is it more efficient but also more secure and easily accessible to individuals participating in these elections. This can lead for business to help increase voter turnout and have a more accurate representation of the publics ideals on where they stand or who they vote for. Further analysis can be done on specific regions leading to even further exploratory analysis to the deep rooted issues that surround Public Policy and Political Campaign as well. In a rapdily changing world it's imperative to be at the forefront of these insights and businesses can use Machine Languages and Data Science to better understand the public perception and beliefs to use for future Policy Making and more effective Political Campaigns. This kind of data is rich with powerful insights, if it were to be tapped into even further, one can make better business decisions regarding these Campaigns. This kind of analysis can be modified to any kind of scale, especially for large scale political results that have massive influence in the direction of the future for any city, state, and/or country. Not only this but also having the ethical integrity which eliminates any potential of malicious intents, errors, or maldoing on any human level analysis.
