Using Python to conduct analysis on these kinds of polls, we can rapidly provide real time results and see important factors for any election at any level. Voter turnout, vote count, the winner of these votes, etc. Businesses and canvassing campaigns can use Data Analytics to get faster results in a more efficient manner considering the large scale of data that is involved with election results.
